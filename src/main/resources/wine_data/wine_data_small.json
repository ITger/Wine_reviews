Rich and weighty, with juicy acidity, this demands many years of aging.","taster_name":"Roger Voss","taster_twitter_handle":"@vossroger","price":35.0,"designation":null,"variety":"Tannat","region_1":"Madiran","region_2":null,"province":"Southwest France","country":"France","winery":"Château d'Aydie"},{"points":"92","title":"Lagar de Bezana 2010 Aluvion Gran Reserva Ensamblaje Red (Cachapoal Valley)","description":"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee. The finish is spicy, with a licorice note, and the wine's tannic composition suggests that aging is appropriate. Drink from 2014–2020.","taster_name":"Michael Schachner","taster_twitter_handle":"@wineschach","price":29.0,"designation":"Aluvion Gran Reserva Ensamblaje","variety":"Red Blend","region_1":null,"region_2":null,"province":"Cachapoal Valley","country":"Chile","winery":"Lagar de Bezana"}]
